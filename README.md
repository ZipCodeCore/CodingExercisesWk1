#### Code Exercises

- Declare a `int` currentSpeed and initialize it to 0
- Change the variable currentSpeed to 55
- print the variable `currentSpeed`

- declare a `double` variable hourlyRate and set it to `18.75`
- declare a `double` variable hoursWorked and set it to `22.0`
- declare a `double` variable grossPay and set it to hourlyRate times hoursWorked
- print out grossPay variable

- Write an If statement that prints "No Overtime" is hoursWorked is less than 40.0
- Add an else statement to the previous If statement that prints "OVERTIME!"

- Write and If statement that prints "Slow Down" if currentSpeed is greater than 80.0
- Write and If statement that prints "Speed Up" if currentSpeed is less than 40.0

- Write a FOR loop that counts from 1 to 100, by 1, and prints the line "ZipCode" each time thru the loop
- Write a WHILE loop that counts from 1 to 100, by 1, and prints the line "ZipCode" each time thru the loop

- Write a statement which sums the numbers from 2 to 9. Do not use a loop.
- add a line that prints the previous sum

- Write a statement which sums the numbers from 2 to 9. Use a loop.

- Write a FOR loops which finds the average of the first 13 integers. Start at zero. Sum the numbers from 0 tthru 12 and divide by 13. Print the `double` result.

- write a method named `maximum` that returns the greater of two integers, x and y
- write a method named `minimum` that returns the lesser of two integers, x and y
